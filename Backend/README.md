### Description of DTDT

It aims to help facilitators to enhance the efficiency of the workshop management and make the tool easier for them to use on mobile-friendly webpages.

### Functionality Description

This tool is to help you to better manage the workshop, with usage of a Miro shared whiteboard. This server essentially interacts with the MongoDB database and the Frontend client Server, to retrieve data from database and send them to the client side. This allows the application to achieve the 5 main features of DTDT.

Other than processing database interactions, it additionally does:
- Enable messaging functionality of the application with the usage of sockets.
- Summarise the notes content received.
